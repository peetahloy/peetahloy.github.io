                        <p> There are people who are in <strong>need of public services but do not know where and how to access them</strong>. Many people in need have cell phones and access to technology at libraries and other public facilities.
                            What can <strong>keep them aware of services, gather information, and make informed decisions</strong> about obtaining assistance? How will they understand how many service providers there are and what associated information is required to gain assistance?
                            Your <strong>task is to design an experience</strong> that <strong>makes it easier for people needing services to obtain them</strong>. Your solution could be a service, website, mobile application, chatbot, etc.
                            Don’t worry about the underlying technology, focus on the experience that a user has.

                        <p>In the early stages of the project, our team generated a wide range of ideas in response to the challenge. We carefully evaluated each concept against the prompt, prioritizing solutions that would be accessible, practical, and empathetic to users navigating complex public services.</p>
                
                        <p>One idea stood out in particular—addressing financial literacy. As college students living on tight budgets, we resonated with the struggle of understanding how to manage money, especially when access to resources isn’t always clear or centralized. We recognized that this gap in financial knowledge mirrors the broader issue faced by individuals seeking public services: a lack of accessible, digestible, and actionable information.</p>
                
                        <p>With that insight, we chose to pursue a solution that empowers users to better understand their finances, identify helpful resources, and ultimately make informed decisions. This direction not only aligned with our personal experiences but also fulfilled the core goals of the design brief.</p>

                            In this phase of the design process, we conducted interviews with potential users from a range of financial backgrounds. 
                            Each team member recruited one participant to evaluate our application and provide feedback. 
                            We started by asking introductory questions to understand each person's financial background and perspective on financial literacy.*
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We then guided participants through the application prototype and asked them to complete specific tasks to simulate real use cases. 
                            Afterward, we gathered qualitative insights on their experience, visual preferences, learning methods, and suggestions for future improvements.

                            <li><strong>General:</strong> The app should have fewer boxes to avoid overwhelming new users. Removing pagination from the resources page can help.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resources Page:</strong> Should be moved under the Lessons page for better navigation. 4-6 resource items are sufficient—pagination, sorting, and filtering may not be necessary.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chat Feature:</strong> Users wanted predefined options to choose from within the chatbox.</li>
                            <li><strong>Budgeting Feature:</strong> Sliders were imprecise; users requested an additional text field for entering exact amounts. Income estimation should include options like $/hour, $/month, and $/year.</li>
                            <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> The order of pages should be adjusted—Profile should not be at the bottom but included in a user dropdown menu.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lessons Page:</strong> Needs a clear indication or prompt explaining its purpose and content.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chatbot:</strong> Should provide visible options and resources for users, as some interviewees didn’t fully experience its potential in the wireframe.</li>
                            <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> A login page with email/password should be included. Users suggested an icon reminding them to update their profile later since some just want information without setting up a profile.</li>
