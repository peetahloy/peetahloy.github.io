                            During the Spring 2024 semester, a new cohort of students advanced ideas for <strong>improving campus orientation</strong> and <strong>navigation</strong> by designing a pedestrian <strong>wayfinding system</strong>. This new system applied <strong>Navigator Type</strong> research and <strong>Mobility Marker</strong> design concepts to visual affordances in the campus environment, such as campus boundaries, popular destinations, timed routes, cardinal directions, and ground-level information situated in the gaze of heads-down phone users.

                                    We then sought to <strong>develop a foundational understanding of light rail systems</strong>: how they function, how users interact with them, and the experience they provide.

                                <p>
                                    From our initial concept sketches, we identified and organized our mobility solutions into <strong>three primary categories</strong>:
                                </p>
                    
                                <h5>Directional Sign</h5>
                                <p>Eye-level signage that helps guide users throughout campus in real-time.</p>
                    
                                <h5>Area Map</h5>
                                <p>A map that highlights major campus locations and key points of interest.</p>
                    
                                <h5>Ground-Level Directions</h5>
                                <p>Wayfinding tools and directional cues placed below eye level, such as floor decals and arrows.</p>
                    
                                <p>
                                    This structure allowed us to <strong>divide and conquer</strong>, splitting into smaller focus teams. Even while working independently, we continuously <strong>shared feedback</strong> and <strong>collaborated</strong> to align ideas and maintain cohesion.
                                </p>

                                    I collaborated with Abraham Neiswinter to develop concepts for <strong>ground-level signage</strong>. Our focus was on wayfinding tools that guide users from the floor—specifically through the use of <strong>cardinal directions, arrows, and street names</strong>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This approach enhances accessibility and usability, especially for people who tend to look down while navigating, whether due to mobile phone use or visual comfort.

                                        We asked participants if they could identify the <strong>cardinal direction</strong> they were heading in to test spatial awareness.
                                    </p>

                                        We wanted to learn whether participants noticed the <strong>cardinal direction indicators</strong> or <strong>street names</strong> first.

                                Our testing showed that the <strong>ground-level signage successfully informed students</strong> about the direction they were heading and the street they were on. Both the <strong>cardinal directions</strong> and <strong>street names</strong> were interpreted easily and effectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <strong>color choice</strong>—especially the use of light blue—significantly increased visibility and noticeability. Many users mentioned the color helped the signs stand out against the concrete and surrounding environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <strong>material and texture</strong> of the signage also played a role in user interaction. Because the signs were slightly raised or visually distinct, several students reported avoiding stepping on them—showing that the ground elements were indeed noticed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, <strong>positioning influenced effectiveness</strong>. In some instances, the signage was missed due to foot traffic or because people were rushing. During peak hours, crowded sidewalks often obstructed the view of the signage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Interestingly, <strong>prior knowledge of the area reduced reliance</strong> on signage. Some students didn’t notice or engage with the signs simply because they already knew where they were going.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A few participants admitted they didn’t notice the signs at all—often due to distractions, urgency, or simply looking at their phones. This highlights an ongoing challenge in catching attention in busy environments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Overall, our findings support the use of <strong>ground-level signage as a helpful, accessible, and intuitive wayfinding tool</strong>, while also revealing areas for improvement in placement and visibility.

                                Vertical directional signage was placed in public areas to observe interaction and gather feedback. The public responded positively—many noted that the signage <strong>clearly communicated direction</strong> and was easy to interpret.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We also laid out multiple <strong>typographic and signage variations</strong> for public review. This helped us gauge which designs were most effective in terms of visibility, clarity, and overall aesthetic.

                            <p><strong>Collaboration is essential</strong> – Effective teamwork enhances problem-solving, strengthens ideas, and ensures a well-rounded approach.</p>

                            <p><strong>The design process is iterative</strong> – Ideation and prototyping aren't linear. Iteration and ongoing refinement lead to stronger, more thoughtful outcomes.</p>

                            <p><strong>Clarity and accuracy matter</strong> – Consistency in presentation is critical. Stakeholders notice discrepancies, so attention to detail is a must.</p>

                            <p><strong>Seek feedback regularly</strong> – Constructive criticism and peer insights are crucial to improving your work at every stage.</p>

                            <p><strong>Stakeholder engagement is key</strong> – Regular check-ins help align expectations and allow room for course correction before it's too late.</p>

                            <p><strong>User-centered design is crucial</strong> – The needs of real users should drive design decisions. Design doesn’t exist in a vacuum.</p>

                            <p><strong>Flexibility leads to innovation</strong> – Be open to evolving your ideas based on feedback, especially when testing reveals new perspectives.</p>

                            <p><strong>Presentation skills are vital</strong> – Effectively communicating your work ensures it is understood, respected, and considered for real-world application.</p>

                            <p><strong>Designing for everyone is challenging</strong> – A solution that works for one group may not work for another. True accessibility means aiming to include the widest possible audience.</p>

                            <p><strong>Wayfinding systems require time and care</strong> – Designing new navigation tools takes extensive prototyping, testing, and revision.</p>

                            <p><strong>Expand accessibility research</strong> – Include considerations for users with visual, auditory, and mobility impairments to inform more inclusive solutions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Explore textures and materials</strong> – Investigate the tactile and functional aspects of signage, especially for ground-level installations.</p>

                            <p><strong>Assess real-world application</strong> – Consider durability, maintenance, and environmental factors in selecting materials and signage placement.</p>

                            <p><strong>Study campus "districts"</strong> – Break down the campus into key zones or “districts” to guide signage strategy and improve spatial clarity in maps.</p>

                            <p><strong>Conduct more prototype testing</strong> – Run additional field tests focused specifically on accessibility and gather input from users with different needs.</p>

                            <p><strong>Iterate designs based on feedback</strong> – Continue refining prototypes in response to both public feedback and expert critique.</p>

                            <p><strong>Expand ideation and experimentation</strong> – Don’t settle too early. Explore more concepts through sketches, prototypes, and alternate approaches before narrowing down solutions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Enhance stakeholder collaboration</strong> – Involve stakeholders earlier to gain insights that can influence direction and clarify expectations from the start.</p>

                            <p><strong>Improve testing and validation</strong> – Conduct more rounds of user testing to refine details, validate assumptions, and ensure the design is truly effective.</p>

                            <p><strong>Strengthen documentation</strong> – Maintain consistent records of your research, iterations, and critiques. This improves transparency and informs future decisions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Refine time management</strong> – Strive for a better balance between speed and depth. Being intentional with your time leads to stronger outcomes.</p>

                            <p><strong>Develop creative resilience</strong> – Not every idea will work. Embrace setbacks as part of the process and use them to grow your thinking and adapt your strategy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Think long-term</strong> – Consider the lifespan of your design decisions and how they integrate with broader campus initiatives or infrastructure plans.</p>
